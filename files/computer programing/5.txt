A class is a description of a number of similar objects. This fits our non-technical understanding of the word class. Prince, Sting, and Madonna are members of the rock musician class. There is no one person called “rock musician,” but specific people with specific names are members of this class if they possess certain characteristics. An object is often called an “instance” of a class.
